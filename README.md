# ChemoDevice


This is the software repository for our BME261 term project. Our goal is to minimize human error in the chemotherapy drug administration process with an LCD display, Arduino Uno and Arduino DUE, and a load cell.

The project is currently under development by a group of biomedical engineering students.
